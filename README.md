### What I learned

As I am currently learning React, this is my first challenge to use this framework.

I learned to think in "components" when building the site. Quite a different approach when you are used to building pages the "regular" way. I tried to make some components reusable like the radio button, used for selecting the tips, as well as the input field.
I ran into some difficulties later on though, as I realized that some of these reusable components had different functionalities. So I needed to adjust make code again.

I learned to use state to update the data, as well as using props for passing data to other components to be used there.

I am excited to be learning more, and to become better at using React.
